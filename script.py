Title: Happy Birthday Hasdrubal

Synopsis:
Riley needs to use his shitty white car to pick up Jonny and Daniel to get to Hasdrubalâ€™s house for his birthday. But, when they get there he's not home. They search all over town, eventually finding him at Spud's and bringing him back to play a game of Apples to Apples where Riley cheats and Jonny and Daniel pretend not to notice.
